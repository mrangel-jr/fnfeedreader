## Getting Started

 You need to clone project

 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/mrangel-jr/fnfeedreader.git
 cd fnfeedreader
 ```

 ## How do i see my tests ?

 To see the tests' result, it's simple. You need only open `index.html` in browser. At the end of page, you will see your results.

 ## But ... How do they appear there ? Where i add a new test ?

 The script(test file) is called in index.html at the end of file. Is called `feedreader.js`. You can insert another tests there !!
